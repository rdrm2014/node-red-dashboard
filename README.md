# node-red-dashboard

This module provides a set of nodes in Node-RED to quickly create a live data
dashboard.

It is a continuation of the [node-red-contrib-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ui)
module created by Andrei Tatar.

## Pre-requisites

This Dashboard requires Node-RED version 0.14 or more recent.

## Install

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`):

```
npm install node-red-dashboard
```

Open your Node-RED instance and you should have UI nodes available in the palette and a new `dashboard` tab in right side panel.
The UI interface is available at <http://localhost:1880/ui> (if default Node-RED settings are used).

## Migration from node-red-contrib-ui

These nodes will replace the contrib-ui versions. node-red-contrib-ui
**MUST** be uninstalled before installing node-red-dashboard.

 ```
 cd ~/.node-red
 npm uninstall node-red-contrib-ui
 ```
 In addition - some functionality is not exactly equivalent. There are breaking changes that will require some re-configuration.

#### New features

##### Dashboard sidebar

The widget layout is now managed by a `Dashboard` tab in the sidebar of the Node-RED editor. From here you can re-order the tabs, groups and widgets, and add and edit their properties.

**Links** are no longer added as nodes in the workspace - they are managed in the
dashboard sidebar. They can now be opened in an iframe - if allowed by the target page.

**Themes** - the theme of the UI is now set in the Dashboard sidebar. You
cannot have different themes for each tab.

##### Widgets

The width and height of widgets can now be set, as can the width of *groups*. These are all specified in units of approximately 50 pixels.

The default width of a group is 6 as it was in contrib-ui ( &approx;300 pixels ). Setting a widget to `auto` will fill the available
width of the group. It is still advisable to use multiple groups if you can, rather than one big group, so that the page can dynamically resize on smaller screens.

Group labels are now optional.

Any widget can be disabled by passing in a `msg.enabled` property set to `false;`. *Note:* this doesn't stop the widget receiving messages but does stop inputs being active and does re-style the widget.

  - **Dropdown** - a dropdown select widget has been added. Multiple label, value pairs can be specified. The choices can also be set via `msg.options` containing an array of objects. If just text then the value will be the same as the label, otherwise you can specify both by using an object of "label":"value" pairs :

        [ "Choice 1", "Choice 2", {"Choice 3","3"} ]

  Setting 'msg.payload' will pre-select the value in the dropdown.
  - **Gauge** - now has 4 modes - *standard* (simple gauge), *donut* (complete 360&deg;), *compass*, and *wave*. You can also specify the colour range of the standard and donut gauges.
  - **Button** - the icon can be set using either Material or Fa-Icons - the colour may also be set. If the widget is sized to 1 wide the icon has precedence.
  - **Switch** - can now also set two icons and/or colours depending on state.
  - **Text** - the layout of the `label`, and `value` can be configured.

The `title` of the UI page can be set.

##### Removed

Radio buttons have been removed. Buttons and switches can now be sized 1x1, and switches can be made to interact (via Node-RED).

## Developers

```
cd ~\.node-red\node_modules
git clone https://github.com/node-red/node-red-dashboard.git
cd node-red-dashboard
npm install
```
The plugin uses the ```dist``` folder if it exists and contains an ```index.html``` file. Make sure to delete it if you want to use the non-minified version.
After changing the front-end code in the src folder, ```gulp``` will update the minified files and update the *appcache* manifest.
